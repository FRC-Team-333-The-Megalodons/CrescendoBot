Robot notes for later

Robot (minus chassis) should operate in a certain order to prevent robot suicide.
1. Pivot moves
2. Trolley moves
3. Wrist moves
4. Intake moves (when applicable)

In the future, this may change as we see that some functions can run alongside others (e.g: wrist and intake).
We would like all the funtions to run in parallel with each other, as long as they DO NOT interfere with each other

Robot States:
    Home:
        - pivot is parallel to the chassis
        - trolley is tucked in (home position)
        - wrist is tucked in (shooting position)
    Shooting:
        - pivot is at an angle such that the shooter is pointing up
        - trolley is tucked in (home position)
        - wrist is tucked in (shooting position)
        - intake wheels feeds note to shooter when ready to score
    Intake:
        - pivot is at an angle such that the shooter is pointing up
        - trolley extends out
        - wrist comes down
        - intake wheels intake until the note hits encoders
    Amp:
        - pivot is at an angle such that the shooter is pointing down
        - trolley extends out
        - wrist comes down
        - intake wheels eject note when robot is ready to score
    Climb:
        - pivot is at an angle such that the shooter is pointing down
        - trolley extends out
        - robot drives up to the chain such that the hooks under the intake are above the chain
        - when drivers are ready, trolley retracts, hooks catch the chain and robot is in the air

Driving:
    - (For now) operator (or robot) should go home after completing actions to avoid robot suicide
    - Should the robot automatically go home or have the operator go home?
        - It might cause less hiccups if the operator tells the robot to go home rather than the robot's default state being go home
    - We're gonna need a manual overide button. Is that on the controller (PS button perhaps) or on the Driver's Station? (perhaps both?)
    - Should climbing be automatic or semi-automatic?
        - Automatic: operator holds climb button, robot preforms the entire climb operation itself
        - Semi-automatic: operator uses 2 inputs to climb (e.g: 2 buttons or the sticks/triggers)

LED States:
    - Default: Some fancy shmancy color pattern or no color
    - Intaking: Solid red until a note has been aquired, then starts rapidly blinking green
    - Shooting (rev up): Solid red until limelight detects that robot is in range then changes to solid green
    - Shooting (actually): Solid green
    - Amplify Speaker: Rapidly blink purple (operator will hold down the touchpad)
    - Trap: Solid red until limelight detects that robot is in range then changes to solid green
