        using absolute encoders builtin Flex  reletive
Wrist: Holds on the Intake and has 1 motor, absolute encoder from REV (use rev lib for it)
        MotorID = 4
    using dutyCycle, converted into degrees, thrubore encoder 
Pivot:  Holds the Slides, Shooter and the Intake, has 2 motors, 1 absolute encoder
        MotorID = 6,7
    using dutyCycle, converted into degrees, thrubore encoder
Shooter: Shoots, 2 motors 
        MotorID = 8,9
    using absolute encoders from flex
Climber:  Climbs, 2 motors
        MotorID = 10,11
    absolute encoders built into the flex
Track:  One motor with a pid controller or a limit switch 
        MotorID = 5
Led: For indication   with the drive team, co-operate with the Limelight subsystem, Intake subsystem, Shooter subsystem
    PMW port
Limelight: for april tag detection, co operates with Shooter and Swerve
